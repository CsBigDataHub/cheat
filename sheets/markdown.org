There are two ways to create links.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

    [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

    [I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

    [I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

    [You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

    Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

    URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
    http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
    example.com (but not on Github, for example).

    Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

    [arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
    [1]: http://slashdot.org
    [link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Or leave it empty and use the [[http://www.reddit.com][link text
itself]].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into

sometimes example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting
isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and /Markdown Here/ --
support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those
language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer.
/Markdown Here/ supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and
not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete
list, and how to write the language names, see the
[[http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html][highlight.js
demo page]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Inline =code= has =back-ticks around= it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or
are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code
blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <pre lang="no-highlight"><code>```javascript
  var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
  alert(s);
  ```
   
  ```python
  s = "Python syntax highlighting"
  print s
  ```
   
  ```
  No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
  But let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.
  ```
  </code></pre>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
    alert(s);
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC python
    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print s
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). 
    But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM
and /Markdown Here/ supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables
to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from
another application.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Colons can be used to align columns.

    | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
    | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
    | zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

    There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
    The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
    raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

    Markdown | Less | Pretty
    --- | --- | ---
    *Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
    1 | 2 | 3
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    > Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
    > This line is part of the same quote.

    Quote break.

    > This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text. This line
  is part of the same quote.
#+END_QUOTE

Quote break.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it
  wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to
  actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can /put/ *Markdown* into a
  blockquote.
#+END_QUOTE

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty
well.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <dl>
      <dt>Definition list</dt>
      <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

      <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
      <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
    </dl>
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <dl>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_HTML
  <dt>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_HTML

My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to
experiment and discover -- hit <Enter> once (i.e., insert one newline),
then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll
soon learn to get what you want. "Markdown Toggle" is your friend.

Here are some things to try out:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Here's a line for us to start with.

    This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

    This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
    This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be
a /separate paragraph/.

This line is also begins a separate paragraph, but...\\
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line
in the /same paragraph/.

(Technical note: /Markdown Here/ uses GFM line breaks, so there's no
need to use MD's two-space line breaks.)
