** Installation
The package has not yet been published to MELPA yet so you'll have to install it manually or use [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][quelpa]].
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(quelpa '(cheat :fetcher github :repo "pbellon/cheat"))
(require 'cheat)
(cheat/setup)

;; Or, if you have use-package & quelpa-use-package
(use-package
    :quelpa (cheat :fetcher github :repo "pbellon/cheat")
    :config
    (cheat/setup))
#+END_SRC

You can change which set of cheatsheet is loaded by default by the package by changing =cheat/categories= value: 

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq cheat/categories '("JavaScript" "Emacs" "CLI"))
#+END_SRC

You can see all available categories by calling ~cheat/list-categories~ interactive function.

Register your cheatsheets folds in the ~cheat/sheets-folders~ list:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'cheat/sheets-folders "path/to/my/cheatsheets/")
#+END_SRC

You can then update the loaded cheatsheets with the ~cheat/reload-sheets~ interactive function to see you new cheatsheets. See [[Cheatsheet template]] to see how to write new cheatsheets.
